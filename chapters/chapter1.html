                <p>FISH camp brought me you, and for that I'm forever grateful. Even though you might not believe
                    it, I noticed how pretty you were the first time I saw you. I thought you were funny and outgoing.
                    I wanted to be friends with you from the jump. It took a while, but we got there eventually.

                        <p>I loved when I started to catch on to your playing dumb and playing up how much
                            you couldn't hear to make others laugh. The idiots thought that you were actually
                            dumb, but I told you from the start I was on to you. I knew you were smart as an owl.
                            I knew from then that I wanted to be your friend.
